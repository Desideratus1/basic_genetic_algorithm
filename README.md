# basic_genetic_algorithm
Requires Python 3.#.

A basic genetic algorithm to show the idea. Starts with several strings of 500 random characters, and tries to find the optimal string within the time limit.

Fitness: Turn all strings into a list of integers that correspond to the equivalent character value, then add them together. The optimal string will contain the character that has the highest integer equivalent.

RUN: python genetic_algorithm.py
